# Makers TestTrack Application
## Tic Tac Toe exercise

This is my solution to the Tic Tac Toe exercise for the Makers' TechTrack application. I am uploading it here for two reasons:

1. **For posterity** - I've never needed to write any Python before, and I enjoyed this challenge
2. **Because I realised I haven't pushed any code to public repos recently.** All my work has been in local git repositories and/or pushed to my local server, and most of my projects on GitHub are private anyway.

This exercise was not a graded assessment, it was just as a practice for learning. I have saved [the initial state of the exercise](https://github.com/danfoy/makers-techtrack-tictactoe/blob/cf2851a1d771cb97d6a4e65a681c11f773bb7cb1/main.py) and [the changes I made during the course](https://github.com/danfoy/makers-techtrack-tictactoe/blob/9042764abb59f7069e234efe2cd32bcdfb337dcf/main.py) as separate commits - you can [see the changes in the diff](https://github.com/danfoy/makers-techtrack-tictactoe/commit/9042764abb59f7069e234efe2cd32bcdfb337dcf).

Because I *did* have a graded assessment to get to, I did not remove the intial instructions, nor comment and document my code to the level I usually would.

I don't have any particular reason to continue writing Python at the moment (I am writing a lot of TypeScript currently), but it was an enjoyable language to use, so I may come back and tidy this up at some point.
